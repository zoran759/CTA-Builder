All the different types of messages you may receive (whether recurring marketing messages, on-demand reply messages, or otherwise) shall be known collectively as the "Programs." Consent to
      receive automated marketing text messages is not a condition of any purchase. Msg & Data rates may apply.</p>
    <p>Message frequency will vary. {COMPANY} reserves the right to alter the frequency of messages sent at any time, so as to increase or decrease the total number of sent messages. {COMPANY} also reserves the right to change the short code or phone number from which messages are sent.</p>
    <p>Not all mobile devices or handsets may be supported and our messages may not be deliverable in all areas. {COMPANY} , its service providers and the mobile carriers supported by the program are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>

You also understand and agree that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, texting words or phrases other than those set forth above or verbally
      requesting {COMPANY} to remove you from our list, is not a reasonable means of opting out. You may be subscribed to multiple Programs across different Short Codes or regular long code phone numbers, and therefore you must separately text or reply

You understand and agree that your agreement to do so is a material part of these terms and conditions. You further agree that, if you discontinue the use
        of your mobile telephone number without notifying us of such change that you will be responsible for all costs (including attorneys’ fees) and liabilities incurred by us, or any party that assists in the delivery of the mobile messages, as a result of claims brought by individual(s) who are later assigned that mobile telephone number.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, WE DO NOT SELL, RENT, LOAN, TRADE, LEASE OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER FOR PROFIT ANY PHONE NUMBERS OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH PROGRAMS TO ANY

When you complete forms online or otherwise provide us information in connection with a Program, you agree to provide accurate, complete, and true information. You agree not to use a false or misleading name or a name that you are not authorized to use. If in our sole

      <p>This Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions is strictly limited to these Programs and has no effect on any other privacy policy(ies) that may govern the relationship between you and us in other contexts.</p>

Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of any Program shall be subject to these Terms unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing.

      <h3>Dispute ResolutionGeneral</h3>
      <p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and {COMPANY} in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and {COMPANY} agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these messaging terms and conditions ("Messaging Terms") or your receipt of text messages from{COMPANY} or its service providers will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow
        for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Messaging Terms, or your receipt of text messages from {COMPANY} or its service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim
        arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE MESSAGING TERMS, YOU AND {COMPANY} ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THESE MESSAGING TERMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, nothing in these Messaging Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or {COMPANY} to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims
        court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and {COMPANY} will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for
        Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Messaging Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting {COMPANY}. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.Notice;
        Process. If you or {COMPANY} intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail ("Notice"). {COMPANY} address for Notice is: 665 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10022, Attn: Chief Executive Officer. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and {COMPANY}will make good faith efforts to
        resolve the claim directly, but if you and {COMPANY} do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or {COMPANY} may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or {COMPANY} must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. (e) Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Messaging Terms, {COMPANY}will reimburse you
        for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either
        the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse {COMPANY} for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
        must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and {COMPANY} agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time
        during the proceeding and upon request from you or {COMPANY} made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. No Class Actions. YOU AND {COMPANY} AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and {COMPANY} agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not
        otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Messaging Terms, if {COMPANY} makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to {COMPANY} address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to {COMPANY} address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
        prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and {COMPANY}.Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations of subsection (f) above (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of these Messaging Terms is found to be
        unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of these Messaging Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <h2>Changes to Messaging Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to terminate or change our messaging program at any time. We also reserve the right to change these Messaging Terms at any time and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued enrollment following such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>
